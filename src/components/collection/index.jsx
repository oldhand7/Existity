						Existity will launch as a collection of 1501 NFTs on Ethereum. Each NFT represents a
						special and unique idea. Existity is not just any jpeg NFT project. Every NFT is unique
						with special characteristics only limited to that NFT. The holders of Existity can earn
						multiple benefits from this. The benefits range from earning a daily token yield for
						holding NFT and becoming part of a metaverse and a community. We aim to deliver the
						most utilization to our holders and believers. Thatâ€™s why we divided the collection to 3
						seperate groups, which all have different functionalities in the DAO to be built.

					<p className="t-faction t-dao mt-12">
						There are 3 factions; 200 golden, 550 cerulean, and 750 crimson.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white t-dao mt-8">
						Golden God is the wisdom part of the platform. Golden members can vote for decisions
						regarding the art engine of the platform and metaverse-related topics. Also, the Golden
						God is the owner of the AI chat grounds where one can chat with the wisest digital being
						alive. Golden NFTs yield 5 tokens daily.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white t-dao mt-8">
						Crimson God is the metaverse part of the platform. The holders of Crimson NFTs can
						only vote for metaverse-related topics in the DAO. Crimson NFTs yield 3 tokens daily.

					<p className="text-white t-dao mt-8">
						Cerulean God is the art-generating part of the platform. Ceruleans can only vote for
						decisions regarding the art engine of the platform. Cerulean NFTs yield 1 token daily.

					<p className="text-white t-dao mt-12">
						In conclusion, each faction symbolizes a different feature of the Existity project,
						different in numbers, creating scarcity and different valuation. Golden faction yields 5
						tokens everyday and the rest goes as 3 and 1 token yield.
					</p>
					<p className="text-white t-dao mt-12">
						These will be DAOs deciding on certain parts of the project. The Cerulean faction can vote decisions on
